TODO
1. The image used for Profile is over 800Kb
There may be some difficulty detecting duplicates between Profile Pics and others

Profile images do not check for duplication
Todo - inline images do not check for duplication, or perhaps they will once all the new images are uploaded...?
Delete all user uploaded images and re-try

2.  If there is 1 image, it's the feature image.  Only show feature image on article page once.  Don't re-use it.
